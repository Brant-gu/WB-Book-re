Circular and rectangular gray obstacles have been added to the scene, ensuring that randomly generated Boids do not spawn inside the obstacles.
When a Boid collides with an obstacle (position is detected in real time), a color change effect occurs, and its movement direction is deflected.
When Boids collide with each other, a color change effect also occurs, and they change direction.
