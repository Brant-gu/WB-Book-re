Box 02-08-01
Explosion fragments gradually disappear over time: particles usually reach the end of their lifespan before reaching the edge of the screen.

Circles appear at random positions on the ground, but the explosion occurs at the mouse position: when clicked, a rocket launches from a random startX position on the ground, targeting the mouse (x,y) coordinates.

In addition to fireworks triggered by clicks, there are also random fireworks: rockets with random target points are automatically generated at time intervals.

Projectile motion: the rockets no longer move in a straight line, but have vx and vy components; vy += gravity in each frame, resulting in a parabolic trajectory.
