This is a repository storing all my unwritten comments, screenshots, and screen recording files.  Only the TXT file with numbers indicates the WB (workbook) I want to have regraded.
And IP2 is the project2 I want to have regraded; its score is currently still showing as 0, so I think my resubmission form might not have been filled out correctly.

I've added the Git links to my WB documents at the end of each TXT file so you can access all the WB documents more quickly.

Thank you very much for regrading my work.
Please contact me if anything is unclear.
