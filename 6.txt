Box 06-08-01
I created a snowman wearing a top hat, with animated arms made of sticks that swing up and down.
A red scarf was added with a swaying effect at the ends. A small blue flying saucer was added, flying around the snowman.

Box 06-09-01
A blue sphere with rings and orbits was created. The center is a glowing blue sphere with a breathing effect. Two mutually perpendicular "energy rings" rotate around the outside. Multiple small red crystals are distributed around the sphere, revolving in orbit and rotating on their own axes. The entire structure floats up and down.
